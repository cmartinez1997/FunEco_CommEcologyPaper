Notes about hypotheses:
Maddie:
High severity -> higher cover of ruderal and seeded species; higher diversity in general
Low severity -> species dependent on fire for regeneration (resprouters); lower diversity than high; unburned lowest diversity of all

Rachel:
More perenniality in unburned, fewer in high severity
Unburned lower diversity, increasing diversity in gradient
More annuals and more invasive in high severity

Ian:
Diversity will follow the intermediate hypothesis
Driven by competitive species at unburned, and rapidly dispersing ruderal species at high severity, everything in between in the middle
More perennial in unburned, more annual in high
High SLA, low LDMC in high
Low SLA, high LDMC in unburned

Fern:
Low severity -> highest diversity
Driven by differences in dispersal
Growth response to fire may differ across the gradient

prelim cluster anlaysis results
- sla driving one group (VETH, PSMA, CHAL) when trait data are centered and scaled
- try to log transform and see if results stay same -- they don't :(

functional groups
- dispersal: wind or not; consult Rachel about other disperal mechanisms
- add n-fixing group (binary)

Feb 24, 2025
- potentially add another functional group
  pollinator status
